# Instant purchase mock

Use this module to test the "Instant Purchase" button without having to enable vaulting, i.e., without having to 
install Payment Services or Braintree. When enabled, purchases made using the "Instant Purchase" button will be created 
with the `checkmo` payment method. Note that you will still need to log in as a customer for the button to appear.
